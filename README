1) TCP-Based Client–Server Communication
The application uses the TCP protocol to establish a reliable connection between the server and multiple clients, 
ensuring ordered and loss-free message delivery.

2) Multi-Client Support
The server is capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously. 
Each client connects independently using the same client program.

3) Multithreaded Server Architecture
For every connected client, the server creates a separate thread to manage communication, 
allowing parallel interaction with multiple clients.

4) Real-Time Message Broadcasting
Messages sent by one client are instantly broadcast to all other connected clients through the server.

5) Concurrent Send and Receive Operations (Client Side)
Each client uses two threads:

One thread for sending messages
One thread for receiving messages
  This enables uninterrupted, real-time communication.

6) User Identification in Chat
Clients can enter a chat name at startup, which is attached to every message to identify the sender.

7) Graceful Client Disconnection Handling
When a client disconnects or types "Quit", the server detects the disconnection and safely removes the client from the active client list.

8) Thread-Safe Client Management
The server protects shared resources (list of connected clients) using synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

9) Dynamic Client Join and Leave
Clients can connect to or disconnect from the server at any time without affecting other active connections.

10) Error Handling and Connection Validation
The application includes error checks for socket creation, binding, listening, sending, 
and receiving to ensure stable execution.

11) Localhost and LAN Support
The server can accept connections on the local machine (127.0.0.1) or 
over a local area network using an appropriate IP address.

12) Platform-Specific Optimization (Windows)
The project uses the WinSock2 API, optimized for Windows-based networking applications.
